## itemCentricRec
#Construction of an item-centric graph recommendation system: 
100 item records and 300 users, with interaction data randomly generated for simple testing. 
It leverages the open-source Qwen3-0.6B as the model backbone, freezing the first 26 layers and using LoRA to fine-tune the remaining two layers. 
It calls deepseek-R1 as a data augmenter.
